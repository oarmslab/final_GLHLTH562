## Executive Summary

### Dataset

We used data from the Well-Being and Basic Needs Survey collected in the year 2020 to assess the risk for psychological distress among non-elderly adults in the United States (US). The survey collected data on demographic variables among 7,737 participants. In addition, responses to the Kaiser Psychological distress scale (K6) recorded in the same dataset were used as the outcome measure. Individuals were classified as being at risk for psychological distress based on their score on their K6 scale. The sociodemographic variables included: age, gender, marital status, race/ethnicity, income level, household head status, US region, level of education, area of residence (metropolitan or non-metropolitan), and LGBT. 

### Research question

1. What is the pattern of psychological distress among non-elderly adults in the United States in 2020? 

2. What factors are associated with high risk of psychological distress?

### Methodology

The neccesssary wrangling of the data was completed. Then the psychological distress rate was calculated and visualized using a bar plot. We then visualized the predictor variables on bar, lollipop, and scatter plots. Finally, logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with high risk of psychological distress. To better visualize our results, we created a Shiny dashboard. Users of the dashboard can select different sociodemographic variables and observe  how the level of distress varies across these different variables. We included a section where one can observe the odds ratio of high psychological distress for any selected variable. More than one variable can be selected to adjust for confounding.

### Findings

The rate of high risk of psychological distress was 16.34%. Factors associated with high risk of psychological distress were being female, unmarried, LGBT, young, or having a level of education below bachelor's degree.
