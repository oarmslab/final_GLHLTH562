## Research Question

::: {style="text-align: center; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 60vh;"}

1. *What is the pattern of psychological distress among non-elderly adults in the United States in 2020?*

2. *What factors are associated with **high risk** of physiological distress?*

## Dataset

::: {style="margin-top: 1em;"}
[Well-Being and Basic Needs Survey (2020)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/HMCA/studies/38388)

- Purpose: track the well-being of adults and their families across the country
- 7,737 individuals between 18-64 years old 
- Data consists of psychological distress measures using the K6+ scale and sociodemographic variables 

:::

## Project Design

**Predictors**: 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
  - gender
  - age
  - level of education
  - race/ethnicity
  - income level
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
 - head of household status
 - number of children
 - LGBT
 - metropolitan area
 - US region
:::

::::

**Outcome**: Psychological distress level (K6+ scale)


## Kessler Psychological Distress Scale

- The sum of the sores lies between 0 and 24
- 1-12 “low to moderate distress” & 13-24 “high risk of psychological distress”

## Methods - Data wrangling

```{r echo=TRUE}
# replace "xml:space="preserve">" with an empty string "" in columns Q30_1 through Q30_6

df[, c("Q30_1", "Q30_2", "Q30_3", "Q30_4", "Q30_5", "Q30_6")] <- lapply(
  df[, c("Q30_1", "Q30_2", "Q30_3", "Q30_4", "Q30_5", "Q30_6")],
  function(x) gsub("xml:space=\"preserve\">", "", x))

# remove the numbers in parenthesis in front of each observation
df$Q30_1 <- gsub("\\(\\d+\\)\\s+", "", df$Q30_1)
df$Q30_2 <- gsub("\\(\\d+\\)\\s+", "", df$Q30_2)
df$PPGENDER <- gsub("\\(\\d+\\)\\s+", "", df$PPGENDER)
df$PPHHHEAD <- gsub("\\(\\d+\\)\\s+", "", df$PPHHHEAD)
df$PPMSACAT <- gsub("\\(\\d+\\)\\s+", "", df$PPMSACAT)
df$PPEDUCAT <- gsub("\\(\\d+\\)\\s+", "", df$PPEDUCAT)

# removing everything but the numbers in columns PPINCIMP 
df$PPINCIMP <- gsub("^[^ ]*\\s", "", df$PPINCIMP) # This leaves the income categories

```


## Methods

1. Determined the overall rate of high risk of psychological distress 
2. Explored the distribution of psychological distress across levels of predictor variables
3. Ran logistic regression models  
4. Incorporated steps 1-3 into a shiny app


## Results:

## Conclusion

- Rate of high risk of psychological distress is similar to what is reported in the literature
- The odds of psychological distress were higher among female, unmarried, LGBT, and younger individuals, as well as individuals with a level of education below Bachelor’s degree
- Applications for global health research
